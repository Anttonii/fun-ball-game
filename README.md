Win the game by getting to the last ball and having the highest score!

Originally game developed in Japan and can be played on browser at:
https://suika-game.app/

## Dependencies

Suika Game depends on the following libraries:

- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- SDL2_ttf
- SDK2_mixer
- Box2D

Makefiles and library linking is handled by CMake.

## Building

### Building on Windows

To build the game yourself you need to have installed the dependency libraries.
The CMake lists file is currently built to work on a personal computer, so they will require tweaking.

Here is an example project structure that works on Windows:

```
ğŸ“¦dependencies
 â”£ ğŸ“‚box2d
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚include
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‚box2d
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‚lib
 â”— ğŸ“‚SDL2
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚bin
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œSDL2.dll
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œSDL2_image.dll
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œSDL2_mixer.dll
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œSDL2_ttf.dll
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚include
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‚SDL2
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚lib
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚cmake
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚SDL2
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚SDL2_image
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚SDL2_mixer
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‚SDL2_ttf
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚pkgconfig
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‚share
```

Essentially putting everything SDL related to their own folder and creating another one for box2d.  
Afterwards the project can be built by running the build script in project root:

```
./build.bat
```

### Building on Mac OS X

Start by installing the dependencies

```
brew install SDL2
brew install SDL2_image
brew install SDL2_ttf
brew install SDL2_mixer
brew install Box2D
```

Generate the Unix makefiles and run make:

```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
make
cd ..
./bin/SuikaGame
```

or use build.sh in projects root directory.

```
sh build.sh
```
